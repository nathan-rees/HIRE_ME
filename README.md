very cool recuresion algorithm


The task:
  "A word funnel is a series of words formed by removing one letter at ta ime from a starting word,
  keeping the remaining letters in order. For the purpose of this challenge, a word is defined as an entry in
  the enable1 word list*. An example of a word funnel:
    gnash => gash => ash => ah
   
   This word funnel has length 4, because there are 4 words in it. Given a word, determine the length of the longest
   word funnel that it starts. You may optionally also return the funnel itself
   
   Examples:
    funnel2("gnash") => 4
    funnel2("princesses") => 9
        funnel2("turntables") => 5

    funnel2("implosive") => 1

    funnel2("programmer") => 2
    
    Posting on my github because I am pretty impressed and its my first "unique" recursive algorithm. (friends thought i stole it from SO xDDD)
    
    *(the wordlist is in my resource folder!)
